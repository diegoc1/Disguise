care th edition thyca thyroid cancer survivors association inc sm www thyca org this page intentionally left blank th edition thyca thyroid cancer survivors association inc sm www thyca org the low iodine diet thyroid cancer patients with papillary or follicular thyroid cancer often receive a dose of radioactive iodine rai about two months after their surgery in an attempt to destroy ablate any remaining thyroid cells in their bodies some patients later receive further treatment with rai thyroid cancer patients also have further testing whole body radioiodine scans using a tracer dose of rai if their results are not clean they may then receive treatment with another dose of rai in an attempt to eliminate remaining thyroid cells in preparation for an rai scan or rai treatment patients are usually asked to go on a low iodine diet lid the diet is to prepare for the rai using the diet is recommended in the guidelines of the american thyroid association the patient follows the diet when preparing for rai either by temporarily stopping levothyroxine withdrawal or by receiving injections of thyrogen recombinant tsh while continuing on levothyroxine the purpose of a low iodine diet is to deplete the body of its stores of iodine to help increase the effectiveness of the radioactive iodine scan or treatment the premise is that when the radioactive iodine is administered the thyroid cells will suck up the iodine because the body has been so depleted this diet is for a short time period the usual time period is around two weeks days or slightly more the diet usually begins around two weeks before testing and continues through the testing and treatment period however recommendations for the time period can vary depending partly on the individual patient s circumstances the following is a combination of diet guidelines from several thyca medical advisors who use urine iodine testing to check patients iodine levels from researchers findings presented in medical journals and at thyca events and from input from our member medical advisory council your physician may have different guidelines please check with your doctor before you start the diet general comments the diet is a low iodine diet not a low sodium diet remember low iodine has nothing to do with sodium sodium is in most foods table salt is sodium chloride not sodium sodium in any form is ok as long as it is not provided as iodized salt non iodized salt is ok for the diet as long as it is not sea salt as noted below you should avoid any product or ingredient from the sea that s because sea based products are high in iodine also this is a low iodine diet not a no iodine diet and not an iodine free diet a low iodine diet reduces iodine consumption on most diets to below micrograms mcg of iodine per day on some diets to below mcg per day the american thyroid association recommends that the low iodine diet include less than mcg of iodine per day the recommended daily allowance of iodine is mcg per day for adults one teaspoon of iodized salt contains mcg of iodine during your time on the diet you may freely eat any foods that are low in iodine up to mcg per serving there are a lot of foods that you can eat pages and have lists however avoid foods high in iodine over mcg per serving also many thyroid cancer specialists guidelines recommend limiting foods that are moderate in iodine to mcg per serving for recipes and a snack list use thyca s free low iodine cookbook you can download it free from our web site www thyca org and print it out the cookbook has over recipes plus lots of tips th edition thyca thyroid cancer survivors association inc sm www thyca org you also can adapt your favorite recipes from your own cookbooks to the low iodine diet to do this eliminate ingredients that are high in iodine or substitute ingredients from the list of foods and ingredients that are fine on the diet if you follow other dietary guidelines due to allergies diabetes other medical conditions or other reasons you can adapt your recipes and meal plans use this cookbook s lists and tips thyroid cancer survivors created this cookbook and donated these recipes to help you with this diet we are proud to share this large collection of recipes plus our handy snack list avoid these foods and ingredients avoid the following foods starting when instructed by your physician before your radioactive iodine test or treatment continue as instructed until after your radioactive iodine treatment often for about hours after these foods and ingredients are high in iodine over mcg per serving according to researchers presentations at our conferences iodized salt and sea salt and any foods containing iodized salt or sea salt non iodized salt may be used for example kosher salt is okay unless the label says that it is iodized or sea salt the reason to avoid sea salt is that all products from the ocean tend to be high in iodine you can usually find plain non iodized salt next to the iodized salt at your grocer read the label one teaspoon of iodized salt has mcg of iodine seafood and sea products fish shellfish seaweed seaweed tablets kelp these are all very high in iodine and should be avoided foods or products that contain these sea based additives carrageenan agar agar algin alginate nori these food additives are seaweed by products dairy products milk cheese cream yogurt butter ice cream powdered dairy creamers whey casein other dairy products note nondairy creamers often have iodine containing ingredients too a study published in in the journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism reported on tests of brands of milk in the boston massachusetts area it reported that ml of milk about ounces or cup or tablespoons contained from to micrograms of iodine and averaged mcg this means that one teaspoon of milk has to micrograms of iodine and one tablespoon of milk has to micrograms of iodine the study also noted that sources of iodine in milk include iodine in cattle feed the products containing iodine used to clean teats and udders and a small amount from equipment cleaning products all low iodine diets given to thyca say to avoid dairy some low iodine diets allow very small amounts of milk or other dairy if not listed in the first three ingredients on a label there is no dairy in any of the recipes in this cookbook egg yolks or whole eggs or foods containing whole eggs egg whites are acceptable because they contain little or no iodine some low iodine diets allow foods with very small amounts of eggs if not listed in the first three ingredients on a label the recipes in this cookbook use only egg whites this list continues on the next page th edition thyca thyroid cancer survivors association inc sm www thyca org avoid these foods and ingredients continued commercial bakery products avoid bread products that contain iodine iodate dough conditioners usually small bakery breads are safe it s best to bake it yourself or substitute with matzos if you read labels closely you may also be able to find crackers made only with flour and water while a few commercial bakery products have tested low in iodine manufacturing processes can change over time the study published in the journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism in reported that the iodine content of single slices of different brands of bread ranged from micrograms to micrograms red dye e in the united kingdom however red dye is ok we suggest that you avoid red orange or brown processed food pills and capsules many red red orange and brown food dyes contain iodine and should be avoided the problem with food colors is specific to red dye fd c erythrosine e in the uk only however the problem is that some food labels do not specify which red dyes are used better safe than sorry for medications the best source is the physician s desk reference pdr which clearly states the ingredients for example rocaltrol in the mcg size is not good for the diet because it contains fd c red dye e in the uk however rocaltrol mcg does not and is safe for the diet you can take two of them to get to the mcg dose please always check with your physician most chocolate for its milk content cocoa powder and some dark chocolates are permitted check the label for other ingredients not allowed on the low iodine diet this cookbook has recipes with permitted chocolate some molasses avoid if sulfured such as blackstrap molasses which has a slightly bitter taste it s okay to use the milder fairly sweet unsulfured molasses usually used in cooking sulfur is not related to iodine however it s a term used on molasses labels some diets don t make distinctions between kinds of molasses and say to avoid all molasses one diet allows all molasses soybeans and most soy products soy sauce soy milk tofu however soy oil and soy lecithin are both okay some beans besides soybeans the national institutes of health diet says to avoid these beans red kidney beans lima beans navy beans pinto beans and cowpeas other diets do not limit beans some diets say to avoid rhubarb and potato skins the inside of the potato is fine iodine containing vitamins and food supplements also products containing iodate or iodide check the label and ingredients and discontinue completely if iodine is included most vitamins with minerals contain iodine if you are taking a medication that contains iodine check with your physician th edition thyca thyroid cancer survivors association inc sm www thyca org limit the amounts of these foods some diets from thyroid cancer specialists and researchers recommend limiting the daily intake of foods that are moderate in iodine to micrograms per serving fresh meats up to ounces per day of fresh meats such as chicken beef pork lamb and veal are fine on the low iodine diet up to ounces according to one of the researchers who noted that meat contains micrograms of iodine per pound whole cuts tend to contain less iodine than do ground meats also check the package label on meats including whole turkeys turkey breasts turkey cutlets chicken and all pork products many food makers inject broths into turkey or chicken or pork the label may not indicate whether the broth contains iodized salt if you are not sure go to your local butcher for fresh turkey pork or chicken grains cereals up to servings per day of grains cereals pasta and breads without iodine containing ingredients are fine on this diet the iodine content depends on the iodine content of the region where the grain was grown homemade baked goods and cereals are best on this diet if you use processed foods read the labels carefully to avoid iodine containing ingredients also remember that labels are not always accurate or up to date rices like grains rices vary in the amount of iodine depending on the region where grown so rice should be eaten only in limited amounts some low iodine diets recommend avoiding rice basmati rice has been mentioned as the best for the diet what about restaurant foods and fast food although restaurants generally use non iodized salt it is not possible to know whether a particular restaurant is using iodized salt or sea salt the manager or serving staff may not know what product is being used or whether butter or other dairy products are present in foods the ingredients that chain and fast food restaurants use may change therefore we suggest that you avoid restaurant foods other than plain juices or soft drinks or the inside of a plain baked potato for most restaurant foods there is no reasonable way to determine which restaurants use iodized salt avoid if in doubt what about manufactured and processed foods some published low iodine diets and researchers presentations allow salty processed foods and other processed foods some of these foods include potato chips and cured and corned foods such as hot dogs ham corned beef sauerkraut bacon sausage and salami currently manufacturers of processed foods in the united states generally use non iodized salt however food processing techniques can change and labels are not always accurate or up to date for that reason if fresh foods are available many patients prefer to eat fresh foods during the short period of being on the low iodine diet they avoid processed food because it is not known for sure whether or not iodized salt has been used for any processed food it is also important read the label to be sure there is no red dye or e in the united kingdom th edition thyca thyroid cancer survivors association inc sm www thyca org in the past some patients have contacted manufacturers asking whether or not they used iodized salt in their products or iodine containing cleansers or sanitizers for their equipment and surfaces involved in food processing doing this is not recommended for the following reasons manufacturers cannot guarantee that the ingredients they receive from their suppliers do not contain iodized salt manufacturers may change procedures and may use iodine based cleaners or sanitizers on food processing surfaces utensils equipment and containers used in processing steps because fewer and fewer manufacturers in the usa have been using iodized salt in their food processing there seems to be a rise in iodine deficiency it might become the practice to start using iodized salt again also some spice blends like chili powder may contain added salt read the ingredient labels on all packaged foods and spices some support group participants have compiled lists of brands of processed and packaged foods low in iodine a list is being reviewed for addition to thyca s web site and as an appendix to this cookbook foods that are fine to eat on the low iodine diet the low iodine diet consists mostly of fresh low fat low calorie foods because of this following this diet greatly reduces the tendency to gain weight while hypothyroid the following foods and ingredients are fine to eat you do not need to limit the quantity except as noted fresh fruits and fruit juices except rhubarb maraschino cherries if they contain red dye or e in the united kingdom and fruit cocktail with maraschino cherries vegetables

vegetables and fresh fruits should be fine for this diet provided that you do not add any of the iodine containing ingredients listed above most sources received by thyca do not comment about water thus they indicate that ordinary household tap water is fine for the diet one source notes that some water may include added iodine to eliminate bacteria and therefore that distilled water is more desirable th edition thyca thyroid cancer survivors association inc sm www thyca org low iodine snacks fresh fruit apples grapes bananas melon etc keep on hand and ready to eat apple sauce check label

labels to be sure that the items meet the requirements of your version of the low iodine diet snack list contributed by nina geiger what if it s not on the okay list on this page or in earlier pages in this book there are minor variations in low iodine diet guidelines provided by different thyroid cancer specialist physicians these guidelines combine the recommendations of several thyroid cancer specialists whose patients have successfully used their guidelines some guidelines say just to avoid certain items or certain food categories and do not give details within categories other diets list foods and ingredients that are allowed without limits on quantities consumed many of our web site visitors and correspondents request details as given here so that they can plan their menus with their own preferences in mind if your health care professional has recommended that you follow a low iodine diet please discuss your diet guidelines with him or her th edition thyca thyroid cancer survivors association inc sm www thyca org more low iodine diet tips vitamin mineral supplements often contain large amounts of iodine so check the labels consider taking a calcium supplement since the diet disallows dairy products avoid brands deriving calcium from oyster shell which may contain iodine iodine enters the body via products other than food many contrast agents used in radiology testing particularly ct scans and possibly other scans contain iodine if you are unsure if you had any such tests in the past several months have your doctor review your files iodine is used as a topical antiseptic such as that commonly swabbed on the skin before surgery including thyroid surgery avoid betadine r soaps and shampoos check toiletry labels for red dye or e in the united kingdom this dye is also used in pills and other medications such as cough syrups check with your doctor if you are unsure whether any of your current medications contain red dye or e in the uk or if you discover red dye or e in the uk in a current medication and wonder whether to suspend taking it while on the diet people on the diet often seek allowed substitutes for basic items as for butter remember that margarine also contains dairy most margarine substitutes contain salt or another disallowed ingredient however some margarines of a brand called mother s made in newark nj and available in parts of the usa seem to be allowed read the label carefully no milk substitute is allowed because most are soy based and the rice based one has sea salt the cookbook has recipes for a milk substitute called nutty milk if you consume alcohol when hypothyroid remember that your body s metabolism is slowed down and that you may react differently than you usually do therefore many people prefer to consume smaller amounts of alcohol remember to use unsalted nuts for any recipes that call for nuts for any recipe that contains salt as an ingredient use non iodized salt and salt that is not from the sea breadcrumbs are easy to make in a food processor for flavored crumbs add parsley oregano and garlic powder your local bakery should also have fresh breadcrumbs instead of whole eggs use whites only doubling the number or adding water instead of commercial salad dressing make a simple vinaigrette with equal amounts of vinegar and oil spicing it to taste with herbs pepper and non iodized salt keep refrigerated be sure to have on hand several allowed snacks finger foods when really tired or too unsettled to face a full meal a small plate of snack foods such as peanut butter crackers and apple sauce or toasted bread with honey a banana and a few nuts is better than eating nothing or breaking down and eating disallowed foods a final note the key to coping well with this diet is being prepared ahead of time especially if you are preparing for rai by stopping your levothyroxine pills and becoming hypothyroid before you start becoming hypothyroid prepare the basics and freeze you do not want to be making chicken stock while you are hypothyroid remember also the handy snack list we suggest that you stock up on snack items from the list for times when you do not feel like cooking

name is jules clancy i love food i love wine and i m the only person i know that is crazy enough to have degrees in both in i was working as a food scientist developing new products for a gobal cereal company when i discovered the world of food blogs i d always longed to write recipes for a living however it seemed like an impossible career to crack into but anyone could start a blog and so began stonesoup after a few months writing i knew this was what i was meant to do i invested in a digital camera and by trial and a lot of error began to take photos of my food in january i took the next step on my blogging path and quit my day job to become a full time blogger stonesoup is a blog that helps people become better home cooks by using a minimalist approach to cooking it allows me to use my food science knowledge for good i focus on reducing the number of ingredients the amount of equipment the number of steps involved and the time we spend in the kitchen to a minimum so we can focus what s important it s about simple wholesome delicious food that is easy to prepare and still fun and satisfying to eat why the free e cookbook over the past year i ve been writing a series of recipes that have only ingredients and take minutes to prepare they ve been published in a number of locations i thought it would be useful to have these recipes all together in the one handy ebook that you can keep on your laptop or computer at work as an at your fingertips reference for when you need inspiration for what to cook for dinner if you do find this recipe book useful i d really appreciate it

world of food blogging themselves love jules x ingredients minutes www thestonesoup com page the story of stonesoup i could make some dodgy jokes about minimalist home cooking being eating out all the time or what happens when you re in a country stricken by famine but i ll spare you in the stonesoup kitchen the focus is on recipes that meet most or all of the following criteria minimal time as much as i love spending a whole day in the kitchen i m always thinking about how i can do things more quickly and efficiently this is where the minutes comes in minimal number of steps this is related to time but i wanted to spell it out separately at stonesoup i m always looking to minimalise the number of steps needed in a recipe i strive to keep the instructions concise but easy to follow minimal number of ingredients a long ingredient list can be daunting this inspired me to create this series of recipes using ingredients or less there are no needless ingredients everything must perform a key function to get included minimal equipment i ve never been a fan of single use kitchen equipment and i know that like me most people are cooking in pretty basic kitchens while some of the recipes in this book may be quicker and easier to prepare with a food processor that s as fancy as it gets there s a section on how to setup a minimalist kitchen later in this book ingredients

ingredient lists and complicated methods can lead to much stress and kitchen confusion minimalist home cooking keeps things as simple and stress free as possible more kitchen confidence if you re new to cooking starting with minimalist recipes will help you get some great simple dishes under your belt and give you the confidence to tackle anything ingredients minutes www thestonesoup com page how minimalist home cooking can help you ingredients minutes is a series of recipes aimed at keeping things as simple as possible the original idea of ingredients minutes came from the lovely sheri over at zen family habits but over time we expanded to minutes to give a little more flexiblity the recipes in this free e cookbook have been published previously on stonesoup and a number of different locations i ve pulled them into one handy e book that you can keep on your computer ready to inspire and answer the eternal question what s for dinner ingredients each recipe can be made with ingredients or less there are a few that don t use the whole so don t stress if there are only or ingredients to keep it realistic the ingedients do not include salt pepper or olive oil since most recipes will use all three of these please note that they re expected to be in your pantry minutes this is a guideline for how long each recipe will take to prepare to be ready to eat but everyone cooks at different speeds so some people may take a little longer especially the first time cooking a particular dish i put out a challenge on stonesoup recently and most people were able to make the recipes in the minutes but a few did take longer ingredients minutes www thestonesoup com page about ingredients minutes snacks starters warm butter beans with rosemary garlic serves as a starter you can either serve this as bruschetta with the beans dished up on toast that has been rubbed with the cut side of a clove of garlic alternatively serve the beans in the middle of the table with bread on the side so your guests can help themselves i ve made this with cannellini beans and butter beans and i have a slight preference for the slightly larger firmer butter beans borlotti beans would also work well as would chickpeas can butter beans g oz drained cloves garlic peeled finely sliced small sprigs rosemary leaves picked pinch chilli flakes optional heat a small frying pan over a medium heat and add tablespoons olive oil add remaining ingredients and stir fry beans until they are golden and warmed through season well and serve with a drizzle of peppery extra virgin olive oil ingredients minutes www thestonesoup com page crostini with smoked salmon sour cream serves as a starter this is one of those effortless starters that feels a little bit special but can be made in a flash from ingredients from your supermarket if you don t have access to capers chopped chives or parsley would work well it s more about getting some visual greenery and freshness baguettes are lovely for crostini but i ve also used crackers or larger slices of sourdough cut into small bite sized pieces thin slices baguette g oz smoked salmon sliced sour cream capers lemon cheeks to serve toast baguette slices lightly on one side layer each round with smoked salmon top with a dollup of sour cream and sprinkle with a few capers and lots of freshly ground black pepper ingredients minutes www thestonesoup com page crostini with buffalo mozzarella peppers basil serves as a starter the success of this starter is all in the cheese if you can t find the freshest buffalo mozzarella don t be tempted to use stringy ordinary mozzarella or boccincini the best substitute would be a fresh goats cheese or even some humble ricotta you can roast the peppers yourself but i find that the jars of pre prepared roast peppers or capsicum are perfectly fine if you re short of time thin slices baguette large ball bufffalo mozzarella torn into chunks roasted peeled red pepper capsicum finely sliced a few fresh basil leaves toast baguette slices lightly on one side layer each round with mozzarella chunks top with a few slices of pepper capsicum and a basil leaf or two ingredients minutes www thestonesoup com page white bean parmesan feel free to use whichever white beans you prefer canellini butter beans borlotti or even fava would all work i m also thinking that chickpeas would be lovely but haven t tried them out yet this puree is a quick and easy starter to serve with warm pita bread or your favourite dipping vehicle another option is to serve it on crostini thin slices of baguette that have been toasted on one side and rubbed with a cut clove of garlic while still hot can canellini beans g oz drained cloves garlic cup extra virgin olive oil g oz parmesan cheese finely grated tablespoons lemon juice place all ingredients in a food processor and whizz until very smooth season to taste adding a little more lemon juice if you think it needs it serve at room temperature with pita or other bread puree cheese with celery this is more of an idea than an exact recipe it came from wanting to enjoy some cheese without the heaviness of bread or crackers there s something just so good about crunching into a stick of celery and even better when it has a bonus piece of rich soft cheese attached this works best with softer cheese but i ve also tried it successfully with parmesan and manchego bunch celery perfectly ripe cheese wash celery and trim the base to break it into individual ribs leave the leaves intact on the inner ribs and discard the darker green leaves of the outer ribs place celery on a platter next to the cheese and season with salt pepper ingredients minutes www thestonesoup com page bocadillo with jamon serves the humble bocadillo is the ultimate minimalist spanish sandwich just a baguette filled with some meat cheese omelette or tuna the spanish do not add lettuce pickles onions mustard or mayonnaise to their bocadillo sometimes the bread is moistened by rubbing the cut side of a tomato onto the bread or drizzling some olive oil or both but mostly it s just bread and one filling i find good quality jamon is flavoursome and moist enough to enjoy on its own if you re lucky enough to be in spain you could make this sandwich with a different type of jamon every day proscuitto or parma ham would make good substitutes if you re feeling nervous that your sandwich will be too dry serve with some good extra virgin olive oil on the side but please try it without the oil first baguette slices jamon break open baguette layer with jamon close up and enjoy ingredients minutes www thestonesoup com page cheese on toast serves the choice of cheese is in your court the mayo makes it a bit moister so you could easily use hard cheese such as parmesan or manchengo for me right now irish cheddar is where it s at also lovely with a slice or two of smoked ham layered under the cheese for an even more rich experience replace the mayo with an egg yolk slices rustic bread butter handfuls grated cheese teaspoon wholegrain mustard tablespoon whole egg mayonnaise preheat oven to c f generously butter bread and place on a baking tray lined with foil or baking paper bake for minutes or until butter is melted combine cheese mustard and mayo completely cover the bread with the cheese mixture bake for another minutes or until the cheese is melted and bubbling with golden brown patches soup simple soba noodle soup serves soba noodles are made of buckwheat as well as regular wheat and have a subtle healthy flavour most other noodles could be used here if you prefer likewise the veg can be varied to suit your taste and what you have in the fridge baby spinach would be lovely remember that the noodles are going to keep cooking in the broth after you ve served up so best to slightly undercook first cups vegetable stock handful soba noodles approx g or oz heads baby bok choy leaves separated large pinch chilli flakes optional tablespoons soy sauce bring stock to the boil in a medium saucepan add noodles and simmer for minutes add bok choy and chilli and t soy sauce and simmer for another minute or until noodles are only just cooked see note above remove from the heat taste and add extra soy if needed serve hot veggie laksa serves laksa is a wonderful coconut milk based noodle soup that hails from malaysia these days you can get commercial laska or other thai curry pastes that take all the hard work out of it i ve used singapore noodles in this recipe which are a fine version of fresh hokkien noodles but i have eaten laksa with rice noodles and even a combination of the two so feel free to substitute i ve cheated a little on the ingredient rule by including mixed chopped vegetables as a single ingredient i actually used a carrot a zucchini and a red pepper all cut into little batons chicken laksa is also really popular prawn or shrimps are lovely cooked in the spicy fragrant coconut broth g lb fresh singapore noodles g oz laksa paste or other thai curry paste large can coconut cream cups cups mixed chopped vegetables see note above handful fresh basil leaves place noodles in a heatproof bowl and cover with boiling water allow to stand for minute then massage to loosen into individual strands drain meanwhile heat tablespoons of peanut or other vegetable oil in a large saucepan over high heat add curry paste and stir fry for seconds quickly add coconut cream and cups boiling water bring to the boil and add vegetables simmer for minutes or until the vegetables are cooked to your liking to serve divide noodles between bowls pour over soup and vegetables and top with basil leaves ingredients minutes www thestonesoup com page chicken couscous soup serves couscous is brilliant in soup as it cooks quickly and adds a lovely hearty texture to make your soup more of a meal in a bowl if you have access to kale or other greens they may be substituted for the baby spinach for a more rustic soup cups chicken stock or broth chicken breasts finely sliced into ribbons cup couscous bags baby spinach washed tablespoons lemon juice bring the stock to the boil in a large saucepan add chicken and cook for minutes or until just cooked through scoop our the chicken and divide between bowls keep warm meanwhile return the broth to the boil add couscous and return to the boil then stir through the spinach leaves until they are just wilted add lemon juice season and taste add a little more lemon juice if you think it needs it divide couscous and spinach broth between the bowls and serve hot ingredients minutes www thestonesoup com page zucchini courgette soup the fastest way to grate zucchini is using a food processor if you don t have one you could get some exercise and grate with a hand grater or just cut the zucchini into small chunks they ll take a little longer to cook the herbs add a some freshness at the end but the soup will be lovely without it cloves garlic finely sliced medium zucchini grated cups tomato passata bunch basil or flat leaf parsley leaves picked parmesan cheese to serve heat tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan and cook garlic over a high heat for seconds or until just starting to brown add zucchini and cook stirring for a couple of minutes add passata and cups water and bring to the boil simmer for minutes or until zucchini is tender taste and season and toss through herbs serve with cheese grated on the top serves ingredients minutes www thestonesoup com page pea pasta soup with bacon serves this is my take on the classic ham and pea soup frozen peas are a life saver when you re in the mood for something green and the larder is empty peas are one of those vegetables that start to loose their natural sweetness and flavour as soon as they are picked so unless you have access to peas straight from the plant frozen will generally taste better i ve used bacon instead of ham and served it in chunks on top but you could skip the bacon and use vegetable stock if you wanted a vegetarian soup rashers bacon cups chicken stock packet frozen peas g or lb g or oz macaroni or other small pasta bunch chives chopped optional cook bacon under a broiler or overhead grill until brown and crispy meanwhile bring the stock to the boil in a large saucepan add peas and pasta and boil for about minutes or until the pasta is cooked stir through chives if using taste and season serve soup topped with bacon pieces salads vegetables top why not round it out to top well i thought through my favourite dressings and this is what came up i could have stretched it to one more but i liked the sound of i vary my ratios of oil to vinegar etc all the time the recipes below should be taken as a guide only unless otherwise indicated they should make enough to dress a bag of prewashed leaves but again it s all up to you caramelised red wine vinegar wholegrain mustard this is my favourite dressing at the moment especially for a salad to accompany a big fryup for brunch i ve been getting my caramelised red wine vinegar from norton st grocer if you can t find any regular red wine vinegar with a teaspoon of honey makes a good substitute tablespoon caramelised red wine vinegar tablespoon wholegrain mustard tablespoons extra virgin olive oil aged balsamic olive oil dressing an oldie but a goodie i love the sweetness of balsamic that is so well combined with the vinegar during the aging process that it seems to be almost savoury i have been known to make a oil balsamic dressing if i m in the mood for something really punchy but the below is more common classic to dress peppery wild rocket tablespoon aged balsamic vinegar tablespoons extra virgin olive oil tarragon vinegar dijon mustard dressing i love tarragon vinegar it tempers the flavour of fresh tarragon and gives an interesting twist to make your own just shove bunch tarragon in a bottle of white wine vinegar and allow it to sit for a few weeks it will keep for ages this dressing is also lovely with a regular white wine or champagne vinegar tablespoon tarragon vinegar tablespoon dijon mustard tablespoons extra virgin olive oil ingredients minutes www thestonesoup com page the top stonesoup salad dressings lemon juice white wine vinegar dressing if you re in an indecisive mood this is the dressing for you sometimes i find lemon juice dressings to be a bit too lemony without being sharp enough this is where the wine vinegar helps tablespoon lemon juice tablespoon white wine vinegar tablespoons extra virgin olive oil onion wine vinegar dressing this is a lovely hearty almost meaty dressing i love it to dress a salad of warm lentils but it s also good on leaves this one keeps well in the fridge which is just as well since it takes a while to make i love how the onions soak up the vinegar and give little acidic bursts of freshness large brown onion finely chopped cup olive oil cup sherry or other wine vinegar heat oil in a small saucepan and add onion simmer over a low heat until onion is soft but not brown remove from the heat and add vinegar and season allow to sit for at least minutes for the onions to soak up the vinegar tahini lemon dressing inspired by sam sam clarke of moro restaurant and cookbook fame i originally discovered this dressing for a roast pumpkin and chickpea salad but it s lovely as a sauce for fish or even to dress a salad with lots of crunchy greens like snowpeas or fresh asparagus haven t yet used it to dress normal leaves clove garlic finely pounded tablespoons lemon juice tablespoons tahini tablespoons water tablespoons extra virgin olive oil ingredients minutes www thestonesoup com page the top stonesoup salad dressings simple lemon juice dressing this is easily my most minimalist salad dressing forget about the oil and just squeeze lemon juice over good with a simple salad of tuna and mixed leaves the token creamy dressing i m not the biggest fan of creamy salads something about the way the dressing doesn t look right on the leaves on potatoes it s another story this dressing also doubles as a sauce for fish or chicken the quantities below make a bit over a cup of dressing which will be way more than you need to dress a bag of leaves cup whole egg mayonnaise cup natural yoghurt tablespoons lemon juice small clove garlic crushed optional caper dressing another cooked dressing this is great for main course salads that have fish or cheese starring in them i ve made it with and without the chives and both are good it might feel a bit weird to be cooking the parsley but it adds a whole different difficult to describe dimension to the salad bunch flat leaf parley leaves picked bunch chives finely chopped tablespoon capers in salt well washed cup extra virgin olive oil tablespoons lemon juice or to taste place parsley leaves in a strainer and pour over boiling water run under the cold water tap then squeeze dry and chop finely place in a small saucepan with capers and remaining oil and heat until it starts to sizzle remove from the heat and stir in lemon juice and chives and season ingredients minutes www thestonesoup com page the top stonesoup salad dressings butter bean tuna salad serves before i was introuced to butter beans i used to make this with cannellini or borlotti beans or even chickpeas all are delicious so by all means mix it up i m a big fan of tuna in oil because it seems to have more flavour if you re really concerned about your waistline though you could substitute in tuna in springwater one of the best things about this salad apart from how fresh and tasty it is is that it transports well and makes a great do ahead lunch to take to work tablespoons lemon juice can tuna in oil g oz drained small red onion finely diced can butter beans g oz drained handful mixed salad leaves combine lemon juice olive oil in a salad bowl and season add beans and onion to the dressing flake tuna into large chunks on top of the beans and gently toss brown rice almond tabbouleh serves i ve used short grain brown rice by all means use whichever rice or grain you like best i ve made this really substantial by adding a heap of almonds if you were serving as a side dish you could easily get by with a quarter of the nuts or ditch them all together lovely with fish or lamb it s a brilliant little bbq salad as it is happy to sit around in the fridge while you hang out with your guests cups cooked brown rice approx g oz large bunch flat leaf parsley coarsley chopped including stalks small red onion finely chopped cup lemon juice cup whole almonds approx g oz in a large salad bowl stir parsley and onion through the rice combine lemon juice and cup extra virgin olive oil and season well dress salad and toss though nuts warm lentil salad with beets ricotta serves as a light meal if you re up for roasting your own beets scrub beets and trim tops wrap in foil and bake at c f for about an hour or until tender the bigger your beets the longer they ll take cool slightly before using in the salad to be fair i was pretty impressed with the canned baby beets i discovered in the supermarket packed in beet juice they are a lot closer to home baked than their old school pickled cousins for a more substantial meal serve with a poached egg on top or if you re feeding a die hard carnivore fry some chopped bacon or chorizo and stir through the lentils for our vegan friends roasted walnuts or pinenuts would make a lovely substitute for the cheese tablespoon balsamic vinegar can lentils g or oz drained handfuls flat leaf parsley leaves picked can baby beets g or oz drained cup ricotta approx g or oz boil your kettle in a medium bowl mix together balsamic and tablespoons extra virgin olive oil and season place lentils in a strainer and pour over boiling water drain well then toss through the dressing mix in the parsley leaves and divide between plates top with drained beets and generous dollups of ricotta ingredients minutes www thestonesoup com page shaved fennel salad with snowpeas mangetout mint serves as a side salad to turn this into a main course salad serve on a generous bed of soft fresh ricotta or crumble through some sharp goats cheese if you don t have a mandoline or v slicer you can still make shaved salads with a sharp knife and a steady hand your fennel might be a little thicker but it won t be the end of the world i prefer to slice my fennel lengthwise but if i m using just a knife if find it easiest to slice crosswise into fine rounds tablespoon lemon juice tablespoons extra virgin olive oil small bulb fennel g oz snowpeas trimmed bunch fresh mint leaves picked combine lemon juice and tablespoons extra virgin olive oil in a medium bowl and season shave fennel into fine slices using a mandoline v slicer or sharp knife toss in the dressing add snowpeas and mint and toss again tuna chilli salad serves tuna with chilli oil is my new favourite thing but feel free to choose plain tuna if you aren t up for a little spice i like to use the oil from the tuna as a bit of dressing for the salad by all means use tuna in springwater drained if you have a low fat fetish bag pre washed salad leaves small or medium can tuna in oil with chilli lemon place leaves in a medium bowl flake tuna and chilli oil onto the salad drizzle over lemon juice and toss gently ingredients minutes www thestonesoup com page baby spinach salad with couscous almonds serves as a side dish if you want this salad to have a lighter more summery feel halve the amount of baby spinach and skip the wilting step cup couscous teaspoon ground cumin bags baby spinach tablespoons red wine vinegar large handful almonds roasted roughly chopped place couscous and cumin in a heatproof bowl pour over cup boiling water cover and allow to stand for minutes meanwhile place a medium saucepan over a medium high heat add two thirds of the baby spinach and cook stirring constantly until spinach has just wilted remove from the heat and stir through olive oil vinegar and couscous season and transfer to a large salad bowl toss through remaining spinach and sprinkle over almonds crisp beef balsamic salad with ricotta serves when a recipe calls for dusting meat in flour before cooking i usually give it a miss but for some reason tried it out on this salad and was so impressed with the lovely crunchy texture that it gave the meat worth the effort if you need it to be gluten free rice or potato or even corn maize flour should all work if you can t get your hands on radicchio don t worry just substitute in you favourite lettuce or even mixed leaves g oz piece steak finely sliced into bite sized pieces tablespoons plain flour tablespoons aged balsamic vinegar head radicchio or other lettuce leaves torn g oz ricotta place a large frying pan over a high heat season flour well and toss beef pieces until well coated heat enough olive oil in the pan to just cover the base when it starts to smoke quickly fry the steak turning once or twice until deeply golden drain on paper towel mix balsamic with tablespoons extra virgin oil and season toss lettuce leaves so they are well coated in the dressing to serve smear the ricotta over two plates top with leaves and the beef ingredients minutes www thestonesoup com page chickpea parmesan salad serves the tricky thing with this salad is that a whole tin of chickpeas can be quite a big eat if you re not super hungry feel free to ditch some of the chickpeas if you don t have any leaves the salad is lovely without them bag pre washed salad leaves can chickpeas g oz drained lemon small handful shredded parmesan cheese places leaves in a large bowl add the chickpeas drizzle with a little lemon juice and toss taste and add more lemon if you think it needs it season sprinkle over cheese shaved zucchini courgette mint salad serves i ve been a big fan of shaved salads for a while now this is an adaptation of a recipe i published earlier it works really well as a side dish for fish but also makes a lovely accompaniment to barbequed meat especially lamb medium zucchini tablespoon lemon juice bunch mint leaves picked and torn thin skinned lemon scrubbed and finely sliced into rounds optional thinly shave the zucchini lengthwise using a v slicer mandoline vegetable peeler or sharp knife combine lemon juice and tablespoons extra virgin olive oil in a bowl and season well add zucchini and toss through allow to stand for a few minutes to absorb the dressing take lemon slices and cut into tiny wedge shaped segments leaving the skin on toss mint and lemon through zucchini and serve on a platter ingredients minutes www thestonesoup com page shaved cabbage salad with parmesan balsamic serves the secret to this salad is to make sure your knife is sharp and your hand steady we want the finest shavings here not chunky ribbons i tend to be pretty ruthless at discarding any chunky bits that are going to mess with my salad texture but it s up to you great as a side dish to pasta especially if it happens to be served alongside fresh tagliatelle al ragu cooked by a cute irishman white or savoy cabbage large handfuls parmigiano reggiano finely grated aged balsamic vinegar preferably years old discard outer leaves of your cabbage and then get to work shaving as finely as you can with a sharp knife discarding any thick ribs as you go place in a large bowl drizzle over cup extra virgin olive oil and toss if the salad seems a little dry add some more oil toss though cheese and season arrange on a serving platter or salad bowl and drizzle over a sparing amount of balsamic ingredients minutes www thestonesoup com page broccoli with chickpeas tahini sauce serves this is broccoli at it s best crunchy and fresh in some spots caramelised and complex in others it seems like so much more than well just broccoli tahini is a paste of ground sesame seeds and is available from most health food stores natural yoghurt and lemon juice without the water make a good substitute head broccoli chopped into bite sized mini trees can chickpeas oz g drained tablespoons tahini tablespoons lemon juice preheat a large frying pan on the hottest heat add tablespoon olive oil to pan when it starts to smoke add the broccoli and cover with a lid or an oven tray it s critical to seal it so the broccoli fries from the bottom but steams at the top after minutes remove the lid and stir return lid and cook for a further minutes add the chickpeas and stir cover and cook for another minute test a piece of broccoli if it s tender remove from the heat if not cover and cook for another few minutes season meanwhile combine tahini and lemon juice with tablespoons water and stir until you have a smooth sauce serve broccoli and chickpeas with tahini sauce drizzled over the top wilted greens with parmesan serves my favourite greens for this dish are either kale or cavalo nero also known as tusan cabbage but it s also lovely with plain old spinach or silverbeet it is one of my all time favourite single gal meals quick and easy and so so good for you it s also surprisingly versatile the cheese can be substituted with all manner of things sometimes i poach an egg or just toast some pinenuts to sprinkle on top if i m craving a fish hit i ve also been known to toss through a can of sardines but i appreciate this isn t for everyone it can also be a great way to use up leftover ragu or even risotto cloves garlic peeled finely sliced bunch or about large handfuls cavalo nero or other greens see note above lemon handful grated parmesan cheese heat tablespoon olive oil in a large frying pan or saucepan over a medium high heat add garlic and cook until it just starts to brown add greens and stir fry until just wilted remove from the heat squeeze through a little lemon juice taste and season serve on a warm plate with parmesan sprinkled over and extra lemon on the side ingredients minutes www thestonesoup com page field mushrooms with feta olive dressing serves this is a great thing to serve vegetarian guests who wil be so excited that you ve gone beyond the standard veggie lasagne or risotto the dressing also tastes great with lamb chops so you could cook up a few if you need to keep any carnivores placated serve with some crusty bread or mashed potato to soak up the mushroomy dressing juices and a simple green salad large field mushrooms tablespoons red wine vinegar tablespoon dijon mustard g oz marinated feta handful small olives heat a large frying pan on the highest heat add a few tablespoons olive oil and add the mushies cover and cook for about minutes turn and cook for another minutes or until mushrooms are soft meanwhile mix vinegar and mustard with tablespoons extra virgin olive oil when mushies are cooked turn stalk side up divide clumps of feta between the mushrooms and drizzle over feta and olives allow the dressing to warm through before serving ingredients minutes www thestonesoup com page pan fried brussels sprouts serves as a main course or as a side dish i know many people who absolutely hate brussels sprouts or at least they did until they tried them cooked this way i ve converted more than a handful of people with this recipe pan fried with smoky bacon the sprouts are sweet and slightly oniony and have none of that aweful boiled cabbage flavour g lb brussels sprouts g oz pancetta smoked spec or bacon chopped large sprigs sage leaves picked optional cloves garlic finely sliced squeeze of lemon juice trim the base of your sprouts and peel away the dark green outer leaves you can either discard these or add them to the pan but they will add a stronger more cabbagey flavour so probably best to omit them on your first attempt take the trimmed sprouts and finely slice lengthwise into or slices heat a small frying pan over a medium heat add a few tablespoons olive oil and allow to warm for a few seconds before adding the pancetta spec or bacon cook for a minute or two and then add the trimmed sprouts sage and garlic saute stirring regularly for approximately minutes or until the sprouts are starting to soften and take on a golden colour ingredients minutes www thestonesoup com page pasta noodles pasta with broccoli pinenuts serves the beauty of this dish apart from the speed to plate is how the broccoli takes on the lightly creamy cheesey sauce i find myself always wishing there was more broccoli and less pasta when i eat it g oz short pasta bunches broccoli cut into florettes cup pouring cream handfuls pinenuts toasted large handfuls grated parmesan cheese bring a large saucepan of salted water to the boil check the cooking time for your pasta on the pack set your timer to go off three minutes before the pasta will be done cook pasta and

cooking water then drain place the saucepan back on a low heat and add the cream pasta and broccoli toss to combine then add the pinenuts and cheese stir until the cheese has melted if it looks a little dry add some reserved pasta water taste and season linguini with rocket chilli oil serves this is the perfect mid week meal all it takes is boiling the water for the pasta grating some parmesan and you re done if you feel inspired to make your own chilli oil there s a recipe on stonesoup g oz linguine tablespoon chilli garlic oil tablespoon lemon juice small handful grated parmesan cheese

mid week entertaining i ve decided to be more realistic with my planning one of the secret weapons i ve developed is to host a chocolate tasting for dessert i used to sample chocolate and biscuits cookies on a regular basis for a living and had the inspiration that tastings could be fun to do with your friends choose three different chocolates it s up to you what type of chocolate you offer for tasting you could choose three different brands of say cocoa solids chocolate and have a bit of a comparison you ll be surprised just how different they will be another option is to go for a white milk and dark from the same producer so you can get everyone to explore which is their favourite type or you could try three different dark chocolates with different levels of cocoa solids or a cheap cooking chocolate a mid range and a more expensive the possibilities are endless really plonk them in the middle of the table for an added level of complexity you could serve them unlabelled or blind as we professional tasters like to say but this can make it a little intimidating for some people maybe save this for a follow up session explore discuss and enjoy you can make it as in depth or as casual as you like i like to keep it very conversational and fun just let everyone taste and talk about what they are experiencing their likes and dislikes if your guests want to get a bit more

your own forget those knife block sets chopping board one large wooden board for all purpose chopping and a plastic one that can go in the dishwasher for raw meat poultry etc if you re vego you could stick to just one board big appliances a dishwasher unless you are some zen master dishwashing fan an oven preferably electric fan forced a stove top preferably conduction or gas and fridge with a freezer frying pans skillets if you live by yourself smallish skillet will be fine but if you ever cook for a few people a larger frying pan will come in handy best to get ones with ovenproof handles

lamb shanks i can t tell you how much i love it but only having one saucepan can be very limiting if you want to boil some spuds for mash to go with your lamb shanks so i think it s reasonable to have another pot i have a mini stock pot that it about the same size as the le creuset that is fine for pretty much anything roasting pan you can also use your roasting pan to bake scones or cookies saving you buying a separate cookie sheet crockery i have a set of blates which are lovely shallow pasta bowls they are the ultimate minimalist crockery because you can pretty much serve anything on them from a steak to pasta you could also use them for soup or cereal if needed i d also include one mug or teacup per person which can double up as an alternative to little ramekins or serving cups for desserts cutlery forget the free set of steak knives you really just need one fork spoon and knife per person glasses a wineglass and a tumbler per person is the minimum because i like to have both water and wine with my meals salad mixing bowl one large bowl that doubles as both is all you really need utensils a whisk for egg whites or whipping cream a can opener a bottle opener although non drinkers would be able to get away without one a spatula for getting food out of the frying pan more versatile than tongs i find a microplane grater for anything from chocolate to cheese a large

effective sharpening system i ve ever used an electric kettle you can always boil water in a saucepan but a kettle is brilliant for cups of tea and boiling water for pasta etc when you re in a hurry a food processor you can live without one but they can make life a lot easier and make purees possible also excellent for slicing or grating large amounts of vegetables a stock pot i love having a big pot of stock simmering while i do other things on a lazy sunday afternoon if you re not a stock maker you can easily live with a normal large saucepan measuring cups spoons kitchen scales if you re not into following recipes then you probably won t need these but they make life easier especially for the bakers amongst us utensils tongs can be useful especially for the bbq when you don t want to puncture your meat a vegetable peeler can make peeling a heap quicker and can take the place of a mandoline for cutting fine ribbons for vegetables i m a big fan of lemon zest while you can use a microplane to do the job i prefer the clean little strips you get from a lemon zester serving spoons are a civilized option for when you have guests although not critical as you could always get people to use their own cutlery or even better their fingers serving platters i m a fan of serving things in the middle of the table so everyone can help themselves but you could always serve straight from the frying pan or pot water filter unless you are lucky enough to have your own rain water tank a water filter is an economical and environmentally friendly alternative to buying bottled water salad spinner years ago i would have included a salad spinner in the essentials but these days there are so many prewashed leaves available you could get by without one storage canisters for years i just stored everything in its original packaging with a rubber band or a peg to seal but there was always the odd moth infestation that kinda grossed me out so i invested in glass canisters containers for leftovers you could pop foil over your plate or leave leftovers in the saucepan but this could be a pain when you want to cook something the next day i have a few pyrex dishes with plastic lids which i love for many reasons they look good they seal properly so you can be sure your lunch will make it to work they are glass so you don t have to worry about plastic leeching into your food and they are oven proof so you can pop them straight into the oven to reheat things cake tins etc i included the loaf pan in the critical list but i do use my cm in round cake tin with a removable base and my cm in tart tin with removable base frequently a bbq as a australian i m really tempted to include a barbie in the essentials but i have managed to live without one from time to time ingredients minutes www thestonesoup com page how to setup a minimalist kitchen the nice to haves again this is just my personal list based on the types of things i like to cook of course your essentials will be different depending on your cooking preferences and style actually i d love to hear if there s anything you strongly disagree with or anything you feel it is a crime not to include oil i like to stock a cheaper extra virgin olive oil for general cooking a more expensive peppery number for dressings and drizzling and some peanut oil for frying salt you could just keep one box of sea salt flakes but it s good to have cheaper grade of sea salt for making brines and salting pasta water pepper i can t imagine a world without freshly ground black pepper sugar or honey caster sugar is the most versatile as it is fine grained so will dissolve readily sherry vinegar soy sauce of all the sauces soy is the most versatile i ve been appreciating it as a vegetarian source of savoury flavours dark chocolate you never know when a chocolate critical moment is going to arise also great as a backup dessert tea i love my tea and couldn t imagine life without it tinned tomatoes perfect for emergency pasta sauce tinned chickpeas if i had to narrow down my canned legume collection to one essential chickpeas would win hands down dried french style green lentils also known as puy lentils these are my favourite lentil small and pretty they are very forgiving and don t turn to mush like many other lentils plain flour it s not called all purpose flour for nothing can be used in baking breadmaking and pasta baking powder not essential for non bakers but my first choice for a leavening agent will turn plain flour into self raising flour in a flash just add teaspoons to a cup of plain flour natural muesli my breakfast of choice dried chilli flakes dried red chilli flakes are my first choice for a little fire nuts for crunch in a crumble or salad or for a healthy snack it s always a good to have some nuts on hand dried pasta i tend to have at least one short pasta and a long pasta like linguine in the pantry worth spending the extra money on the artisanal stuff basmati arborio rice my two favourite rice potatoes as anyone with an irish boyfriend knows potatoes are an essential pantry item garlic it keeps for ages and makes a world of difference to many dishes lemons i have this thing that if i have lemons and parmesan and loo paper in the house then everything will be all right parmesan cheese there are few things that can t be improved with a grating of fresh parmigiano reggiano i also love it as a snack rosemary critical for roast spuds and easy to grow it s one of my few surviving fresh herbs also keeps well in the freezer free range eggs if you have eggs you have a meal ingredients minutes www thestonesoup com page my minimalist pantry the essentials brown sugar i love brown sugar for sprinkle on my porridge or for baking can be substituted for palm sugar in asian cooking vinegar i have a massive vinegar collection which will be hard to part with but i think i can do it if i keep a well aged balsamic a light white wine vinegar and my sarsons brown malt vinegar that i picked up in ireland to splash over takeaway fish and chips sesame oil a little goes a long way i love a little drizzled over steamed greens and steamed whole fish oyster sauce fish sauce after soy these two are my go to sauces for asian cooking golden syrup desiccated coconut these are sentimental ingredients i like to have on hand in case i get a craving for my mum s chocolate caramel slice anchovies capers both are brilliant to brighten up your cooking anchovies also have the ability to enhance the meaty flavours in a stew preserved lemons another little ray of salty sunshine that can make a world of difference to your food canned butter beans cannellini beans and lentils if chickpeas are the essential canned legume it is nice to have some or all of the above on hand for almost instant salads or purees strong flour also known as bakers flour or high protein flour this is the best for baking bread pizza crusts or home made egg pasta of course non bakers can skip this semolina for adding texture to fresh pasta and giving pizza bases and bread a rustic crunchy base all bran for beefing up the fiber content in my breakfast ground cumin ground coriander smoked paprika these are the three spices i rely on the most purists will argue that they should be whole seeds but minimalists will see the benefits of not needing another piece of equipment to grind their spices cocoa powder for making puddle cookies and best ever cocoa brownies definitely not essential but good to have on hand for baking or for a hot chocolate when someone has depleted your chocolate stash dried fruit at the moment i have some dried sweetened cranberries that can be used in salads or baking vegemite lovely with avocado on toast but i won t try and convert any non australians just yet vanilla beans sometimes if i m feeling a bit impoverished i use vanilla extract or vanilla bean paste instead other grains while pasta and rice are essentials i do like to keep different grains on hand barley

eating hot tasty inexpensive food fast food is any ready to eat food purchased and eaten away from home including food from restaurants and convenience stores fast food is an american original it was invented here it reflects american attitudes and culture in that it embodies everything we value it is tasty convenient inexpensive and most importantly fast other factors in the popularity of fast food are that there is no preparation required before meals and no dishes to clean afterwards fast food is so popular in fact that today almost half of our food dollars are spent on fast foods if you really care about your health you know that avoiding tobacco exercising regularly and eating healthy foods are necessary but is it possible to eat fast food and still be healthy it is if you order the right kinds of fast food and this guide will show you how to do it by following three easy rules you can eat out and still eat healthy before you turn to see if your favorite fast food items are healthy however you should read this introduction it will explain why you should really care about choosing healthy fast foods and it will help you understand how the guide was put together it is impossible to have a guide that everyone agrees with because people have different perspectives and ideas about what is and is not healthy however this guide was developed with the best science available and it was carefully reviewed by a national panel of nutrition experts this is not the only fast food guide available but it represents the most comprehensive collection of nutritional data for fast food restaurants across the united states it will help you navigate the fast food maze and make food choices that actually contribute to good health not chronic disease if fast food is so much a part of our american culture why do we need a fast food guide as a population americans have more body fat now than any other population at any time in human history that s right there has never been a population in world history that has had more body fat than americans do right now the most recent data from the centers for disease control shows that of men in the united states are overweight or obese just over of women are overweight or obese and children and adolescents are not immune these two youngest groups in the american population have experienced the greatest increases in body fat of the past years americans also have more type ii diabetes than at any other time in history excessive body weight and diabetes cause many chronic diseases and will likely shorten the average lifespan in the united states by two to five years consequently this may be the first time in the past century that children will die at a younger age than their parents so what does any of this have to do with fast food stop go fast food nutrition guide stop go fast food nutrition guide despite great taste low cost and convenience there is a darker less desirable side of fast food much of the fast food americans eat does not contribute to a healthy weight and most of it may actually cause chronic diseases like heart disease cancer diabetes and many others here s the proof when you compare people who eat a lot of fast food with people who don t there are several differences between the two groups fast food eaters consume more dietary fat and saturated fat they also have more body fat and they eat fewer fruits and vegetables studies have shown this to be true for children black and white adolescent girls college aged adults and middle aged adults one study that took years to complete showed that eating fast food was associated with diabetes and weight gain it also seems that if you live near a lot of fast food restaurants you are likely to eat more fast foods a study in ontario canada found that people who lived near a lot of fast food restaurants were more likely to have heart disease and even premature death another study revealed a correlation between the number of fast food restaurants per square mile and obesity in the contiguous states the states with the most fast food restaurants per square mile also had the highest rates of obesity researchers in new zealand gathered information from children and found a direct relationship between asthma and the number of hamburgers children ate those who ate the most hamburgers had the most asthma the bad side of fast food is not just a problem for american citizens hispanic and asian american adolescents who have recently immigrated to the united states quickly assimilate american culture within one year after arriving in the united states many immigrants exercise less and start to eat more fast foods typical american behaviors that lead to obesity and chronic disease they learn to live like americans and they will die like americans but wait it gets worse what the results of this research revealed is bad but the problems with eating most fast food are much worse researchers from around the world have been carefully studying what people eat and what diseases they get later in life using very large research studies they have been able to identify diets that either contribute to good health or are associated with chronic diseases there are two diet patterns that appear to either cause or prevent chronic diseases the diet pattern associated with the best health is called the prudent diet the diet that is the most unhealthy is called the western diet western refers to countries that have become westernized basically the industrialized nations of the world that are a lot like america this western diet is fairly typical of what many americans eat especially those who eat a lot of fast food typical foods of the western diet include the following red meat french fries refined flours butter processed meat high fat dairy products few fruits and vegetables sweets and desserts the prudent diet on the other hand is quite different the pyramid below shows what the prudent diet looks like for many americans it may look nothing like what they normally eat the prudent diet pattern http www hsph harvard edu nutritionsource used with permission the top of the pyramid suggests that foods shown here should be eaten sparingly notice that many of the foods listed there are part of the western diet the prudent diet is based on healthy plant oils whole grains fruits and vegetables nuts and legumes beans fish poultry and eggs which of these patterns best describes your diet do you follow a prudent diet or a western diet through large studies with hundreds of thousands of participants researchers determined that if you follow a prudent diet you lower your risk of developing diabetes by but if you follow a western diet your risk of developing diabetes increases by the prudent diet is associated with a decrease in risk of heart stop go fast food nutrition guide stop go fast food nutrition guide disease and the western diet was linked with a increase in heart disease risk these two diet patterns were even associated with other chronic diseases like colon cancer and strokes those who eat a prudent diet reduce their risk of chronic disease those who eat a western diet significantly increase their risk while these two diet patterns were accurate in describing who might and who might not get diabetes heart disease stroke and colon cancer not all chronic diseases are related to these two diet patterns when the same patterns were used to determine who might get breast or prostate cancer there was no difference between the two however a prudent diet does appear to help breast cancer survivors avoid other causes of death not associated with the cancer individuals who eat typical american fast food are eating a western diet most fast food contains a lot of red and processed meats white flour butter and other high fat dairy products french fries and sweets and desserts are very popular fast foods in fact fast food is a western diet that means that most fast food is actually causing many of the chronic diseases most americans suffer from including obesity there s more ahhh the smell of fresh pastries cookies and cakes who can resist almost all foods that are commercially fried are fried in trans fats we ve been hearing a lot about trans fats in the news and now all packaged foods are required to display information about trans fat content trans fats are plant oils that are altered in a process called hydrogenation in this process healthy plant oils are heated to about degrees and hydrogen gas and a metal catalyst are added this makes the vegetable oil accept additional hydrogen atoms and presto what used to be a healthy vegetable oil is now a saturated fat with special properties it can be used to fry food over and over again without going rancid and it has a very long shelf life almost all fast food restaurants use trans fats for frying because it is relatively inexpensive furthermore trans fats have a texture most people like for example margarine which is made mostly from trans fats is softer than real butter and easier to work with and pie crusts crackers and croissants are flakier when made with trans fats this is where science once again shows us some warning signs there have been studies that have looked at links between trans fats and chronic disease all but of the studies showed that consuming trans fats is probably harmful the prudent diet pyramid shows that healthy plant oils like olive peanut and soybean oil should be part of a healthy diet these oils are high in poly and monounsaturated fats they are actually good for you because they improve your blood cholesterol trans fats on the other hand dramatically increase your risk of heart disease because they make cholesterol worse in fact trans fats are thought to be times worse than saturated fats if you are going to eat fast foods you are going to dramatically increase your risk of heart attack and stroke because most fast foods contain a lot of trans fats this research is so convincing that the latest u s government nutrition recommendations encourage americans to keep the intake of trans fats as low as possible the minimum amount of trans fats a person can consume and not increase risk is zero dr walter willett chair of the department of nutrition at the harvard school of public health recently stated in europe food companies hired chemists and took trans fats out in the united states they hired lawyers and public relations people no one doubted trans fats have adverse affects on health and still companies were not taking it out any fast food that is deep fried is likely to be fried in trans fats as you will see in this guide some fast food companies no longer use trans fats but most still do if the safe recommended amount of trans fats is zero should you eat a large order of mcdonald s french fries if it contains grams of trans fats what about the yummy doughnuts at krispy kreme they are fried in trans fats and in this guide they are all coded red to help remind you to avoid eating them since fast food is purchased hot it is not required to have a nutrition label and you will never really know about the trans fat content think of all the fried foods in american fare french fries onion rings corn dogs popcorn seafood chips and oooh those bakery goods maple bars doughnuts croissants clairs all of them are either made with trans fats or are deep fried in trans fats the only way you would know would be if you were to see a list of the ingredients or to read the label on the oil being used you won t see the words trans fats in the ingredients if a food has trans fats it will be listed as partially hydrogenated oil the technical term for trans fats according to a survey conducted by the center for science in the public interest cspi the biggest restaurant chains still fry french fries chicken nuggets and other foods in trans fats the cspi survey which included major food manufacturers restaurant chains and supermarket chains revealed many interesting insights into the fast food industry for example while several major restaurant chains including taco bell and pizza hut are testing healthier oils only a few chains have already taken action to actually use healthier oils stop go fast food nutrition guide the good guys au bon pain a location caf chain based in boston has eliminated trans fat from all of its cookies bagels and muffins and is now using a nonhydrogenated margarine jason s deli a outlet sandwich and salad chain has stopped using partially hydrogenated oils in all of its products panera bread a outlet caf chain that was formerly part of au bon pain is in the process of replacing all partially hydrogenated oils and plans to be trans fat free by year s end california pizza kitchen has removed trans fat from deep fried foods and is working on eliminating it from all other foods in ruby tuesday with some table service restaurants around the country began deep frying in heart healthy canola oil chick fil a fries in peanut oil in its outlets the bad guys starbucks ice cream chain friendly s and fried chicken chain popeyes indicated they had no plans to remove or reduce trans fat in their foods meals at other restaurants also are loaded with trans fat kfc s chicken pot pie contains grams of trans and taco bell s nachos bellgrande has grams from http www cspinet org new pdf trans report pdf in mcdonald s promised to reduce and ultimately eliminate the trans fat in its cooking oil but in it quietly backed away from this effort mcdonald s lost a lawsuit related to this matter and was ordered to give million to the american heart association to be used to educate the public about the dangers of trans fats mcdonald s has reformulated its chicken mcnuggets and a few other products to have a little less trans fat but its fried foods are still very high in trans fats a mcdonald s meal that includes a five piece chicken selects breast strips order and a medium order of french fries has about grams of trans fats a piece of baked apple pie at mcdonald s has grams isn t it strange that mcdonald s outlets in australia denmark and israel all fry in trans fat free oil but americans still get the trans fats so what s the big deal if americans would reduce the amount of trans fats they are currently eating it is estimated that to heart disease deaths would be prevented every year that would provide a bigger improvement in public health than just about any other medical breakthrough in the past years but this guide isn t just about trans fats fruits and vegetables and whole grains are also very important a review of the science reveals that americans who increase their fruit and vegetable stop go fast food nutrition guide consumption from two servings per day to five or more can cut their risk of many cancers in half obviously scientists haven t answered all the nutrition questions but they have discovered enough information to help americans prevent arrest and even reverse most chronic diseases all it takes is good nutrition regular physical activity and avoiding tobacco use be careful what you order a quick look at many of the foods in this guide reveals a few surprises first of all the calorie content of some of america s fast food is shocking let s put this into perspective the average person weighs pounds when walking at a pace of miles per hour that person expends about calories per minute say you decide to have dinner at chili s and for a starter you order the awesome blossom this starter contains calories if you were the average person you would have to walk miles to burn off all the calories you just ate and it would take you about hours of walking to do it the table below shows some other fast food calorie counts that you might find enlightening appetizer starters chili s awesome blossom denny s mini burgers w onion rings entr es mcdonald s hamburger mcdonald s big mac romano s macaroni grill spaghetti meatballs dinner nathan s famous seafood sampler shoney s deluxe pancake plate lone star steakhouse lone star wings o charley s chicken tenders dinner dessert romano s macaroni grill new york cheesecake with caramel fudge sauce calories miles you would need to walk to burn off these calories miles miles miles miles miles miles miles miles miles miles how long you have to walk hours hours hour hours hours hours hours hours hours hours how this guide was developed to help you make healthy fast food choices almost different foods have been color coded after an exhaustive process used to determine if a food should be red yellow or green we contacted the largest fast food companies in america and requested nutrition information about each of their menu items companies are not required by law to provide the nutrition information for the foods they sell this is strictly voluntary and most stop go fast food nutrition guide stop go fast food nutrition guide companies do not have any nutrition information about their foods still we were able to gather nutrition information from restaurants the available nutrition information on these fast foods was then entered into a large database and specifically designed computer programs identified foods that had any of the following characteristics more than gram of trans fat per serving more than grams of saturated fat per serving more than milligrams of cholesterol per serving more than milligrams of sodium per serving there is nothing magical about these criteria except that some of them represent half the daily value for an average person in other words if a single fast food serving had more than half the amount of saturated fat cholesterol or sodium that a person should have in a single day it was identified foods that contained lots of trans fats and little fiber were also identified any food that met none or just one of these criteria started off as green any food that met two of the criteria was initially coded yellow and any food that met three or more of the criteria was coded red kind of like three strikes and you re out there is an easier way to think about this coding by using the prudent diet pyramid a similar type of coding could be done the pyramid shown below shows how foods could be coded according to where they are located on the pyramid healthy green coded foods would be those at the bottom of the pyramid yellow toward the middle and red foods which should be eaten sparingly are located at the top red meat butter use sparingly adapted from http www hsph harvard edu nutritionsource a further set of rules was also established to help in the coding process any food that had more than gram of trans fat was automatically coded red foods that contained processed meats meats like pepperoni bacon sausage bologna and hot dogs or more than the recommended serving of red meat were also coded red foods that were initially coded as yellow and had amounts of sodium saturated fat or cholesterol that were not extremely high but were leaning in that direction were moved to red to ensure consistent coding the entire fast food dataset was reevaluated and coded three times to further classify the foods a distinguished panel of national nutrition and health promotion experts from across the united states was organized these experts reviewed the entire process and suggested changes in the way the foods were coded the experts are listed in the acknowledgments section a final analysis shows that of the foods in this guide are coded green are coded yellow and are coded red fast food and good health with three easy rules how can you make the best choices when you re eating fast food this guide codes food as red yellow or green depending on how healthy they are or not here are three easy rules to help you use this system to make healthy fast food choices rule avoid the red foods rule go easy on the yellow foods rule eat healthy with the green foods red foods hit the brakes there are many factors that result in a red code for a food the number one factor why many foods receive a red code is that they contain more than one gram of trans fat lots of foods are coded red because they have more than one gram of trans fat content almost all of the foods at taco bell for example are coded red because they contain large amounts of trans fats many restaurants do not report the trans fat content of their foods indicated in the table as not available na leading us to believe that they are still frying in trans fats see popeyes chicken biscuits for example consequently they are coded red french fries are coded red because almost all restaurants fry them in trans fats any company that switches to healthier oils could instantly get a change in its food colors for example the in n out burger chain located in california nevada and arizona fries in cottonseed oil that is not hydrogenated it s trans fat free and better for you but french fries should still be a small part of a healthy stop go fast food nutrition guide diet in n out burger s french fries get a green code the only other restaurant that uses healthy oils for frying is chick fil a which has mostly green coded foods because they fry in peanut oil as you will read later foods fried in healthy oils can actually be good for you panda express does not use trans fats in any of its fried food and is the only restaurant in this entire guide that receives a green code for all of its foods on the other hand doughnut producers krispy kreme and dunkin donuts have only red coded foods because they are all made with trans fats one doughnut can have as much as grams of trans fats doughnuts are a wonderful treat but they are also a food that should be eaten very sparingly if you care about good health foods made with processed meats or that have a large serving of red meat are also coded red a mcdonald s regular hamburger the small one that has just a squirt of ketchup mustard and a pickle is actually coded green it contains a small serving of red meat and not very many calories a big mac on the other hand is a real heavy hitter with half the saturated fat for a whole day and trans fats how would you color code a pizza hut meat lover s pizza even though it doesn t contain any trans fats it gets a red in this guide because one slice contains a lot of saturated fat sodium and processed meat desserts typically offered at restaurants are coded red because they generally contain a lot of calories saturated fat refined flour and sugars therefore desserts should be an occasional treat not foods we eat often yellow foods exercise caution what about a pizza that doesn t contain any processed meat your basic cheese pizza gets a yellow code although it doesn t contain trans fats or processed meat it also doesn t contain any vegetables or whole grains it s kind of in the middle that s what yellow foods are like they aren t good enough to be coded green or bad enough to deserve being branded red some yellow foods include cheese pizza sweet and sour chicken a single taco or burrito frozen yogurt green foods you re eatin healthy green foods are the best to earn the green badge of honor a food has to have certain qualities that make it part of a healthy daily diet obviously foods made with whole grains fruits vegetables and healthy oils will be coded green green coded foods include vegetable pizza many sandwiches salads eggs and entr es made with vegetables such as vegetable stir fry green foods are low in saturated and trans fats they don t contain excessive amounts stop go fast food nutrition guide of sodium or cholesterol and they are relatively low in calories compared to yellow and red foods they are actually good for you and could be eaten every day by choosing green foods you can eat fast food and still eat healthy the best of both worlds another way to identify green foods is to ask the question is this food close to its natural original form a salad for example contains foods close to their natural form a hostess twinkie on the other hand leaves us to wonder what its natural form actually was a baked potato is going to be coded green but trans fat fried tater tots are going to be red you get the idea some restaurants are healthier than others as you will see in this guide some fast food restaurants sell a lot of red foods others have a lot more healthy choices based on the types of foods a restaurant serves it is possible to produce a short list of restaurants ranked from best to worst according to the color coding of the food they sell counting up the number of green yellow and red foods sold by different restaurants shows that some restaurants offer healthier foods than others worst breakfastspecialty denny s wafflehouse traditional fast food with trans fats burger king kfc mcdonald s mexican tacobell deltaco tacojohn s italian

should know about fast food restaurants are really designed and created to do one thing sell as much food as possible it doesn t matter if people eat the food because the main goal is to sell food to do this food venders use time tested methods to get each customer to buy as much food as possible no one likes to waste food so when we do purchase a little extra food the only responsible thing to do is eat it don t fall prey to these tricks and you won t feel obligated to eat all the food you buy up selling would you like egg rolls with that order do you want me to super size your meal would you like to make that a combo meal these are all questions you might be asked next time you order fast stop go fast food nutrition guide food it s called up selling you ve already ordered what you want you re ready to pay and the person working at the counter asks you an up sell question the idea is to get as much money out of you as possible by selling you more food food that you may or may not want or need mcdonald s super sizing items and selling foods as part of a combo meal are examples of effective ways fast food restaurants get just a little more out of you each time you visit don t fall for it decide what you want before you get to the counter hopefully picking green coded foods and don t buy any more food no matter how hard the employee tries to sell it to you what smells so good have you ever walked past a restaurant and smelled barbeque fresh bread or hot pastries most food producers don t purposely fill the air with the smells of their foods but some do by setting up a barbeque grill outside or venting kitchen grill smoke to the outside they are advertising their food to the olfactory senses of the masses if you re hungry and you ve got a little extra cash you may end up as their next customer it s all about the playground forget about the food the kids will want to play at the fast food playground slides treehouses ball pits and swings are attractive to small children and playgrounds and even arcades have become common features in fast food restaurants restaurants know parents want to watch their kids play in a relatively confined space while they eat in peace the combination of food and an attraction for the kids is a powerful marketing ploy unfortunately the food often doesn t contribute to good health forget the food i want the toy the fast food industry excels at getting to us through our kids and the kid s meal is another powerful fast food marketing tactic hollywood and the fast food industry have collaborated to create a marriage between fast food and movie marketing that results in children begging for the next plastic action hero that comes with fast food they might or might not eat after all what could be better than sharing a deep fried meal with luke skywalker it s all in a name restaurant owners are pros at getting us to buy and eat if a menu has chocolate cake it won t sell well but if the same menu has black forest double chocolate cake the customer will be much more likely to purchase it and much more likely to approve of the taste why would romano s macaroni grill sell cheesecake when it can sell new york cheesecake with caramel fudge sauce just the name of the food can impact sales and customer satisfaction don t be swayed too stop go fast food nutrition guide much by the names listen to your body and let your stomach tell you when you are full fast food is only part of the problem it wouldn t be fair to place all of the blame for america s poor health on the fast food industry there are several reasons why americans are not as healthy as they should be regardless of what we eat we eat too much we don t get much exercise and we have a culture and environment that discourage healthy eating and regular physical activity this guide is designed to help you still enjoy fast food by selecting fast foods that are actually good for you when combined with regular exercise you will be well on your way to

tucker phd andrew weil md fast food is awesome you pull up in your car speak into a microphone and in less than seconds you are eating hot tasty inexpensive food fast food is any ready to eat food purchased and eaten away from home including food from restaurants and convenience stores fast food is an american original it was invented here it reflects american attitudes and culture in that it embodies everything we value it is tasty convenient inexpensive and most importantly fast other factors in the popularity of fast food are that there is no preparation required before meals and no dishes to clean afterwards fast food is so popular in fact that today almost half of our food dollars are spent on fast foods if you really care about your health you know that avoiding tobacco exercising regularly and eating healthy foods are necessary but is it possible to eat fast food and still be healthy it is if you order the right kinds of fast food and this guide will show you how to do it by following three easy rules you can eat out and still eat healthy before you turn to see if your favorite fast food items are healthy however you should read this introduction it will explain why you should really care about choosing healthy fast foods and it will help you understand how the guide was put together it is impossible to have a guide that everyone agrees with because people have different perspectives and ideas about what is and is not healthy however this guide was developed with the best science available and it was carefully reviewed by a national panel of nutrition experts this is not the only fast food guide available but it represents the most comprehensive collection of nutritional data for fast food restaurants across the united states it will help you navigate the fast food maze and make food choices that actually contribute to good health not chronic disease if fast food is so much a part of our american culture why do we need a fast food guide as a population americans have more body fat now than any other population at any time in human history that s right there has never been a population in world history that has had more body fat than americans do right now the most recent data from the centers for disease control shows that of men in the united states are overweight or obese just over of women are overweight or obese and children and adolescents are not immune these two youngest groups in the american population have experienced the greatest increases in body fat of the past years americans also have more type ii diabetes than at any other time in history excessive body weight and diabetes cause many chronic diseases and will likely shorten the average lifespan in the united states by two to five years consequently this may be the first time in the past century that children will die at a younger age than their parents so what does any of this have to do with fast food stop go fast food nutrition guide stop go fast food nutrition guide despite great taste low cost and convenience there is a darker less desirable side of fast food much of the fast food americans eat does not contribute to a healthy weight and most of it may actually cause chronic diseases like heart disease cancer diabetes and many others here s the proof when you compare people who eat a lot of fast food with people who don t there are several differences between the two groups fast food eaters consume more dietary fat and saturated fat they also have more body fat and they eat fewer fruits and vegetables studies have shown this to be true for children black and white adolescent girls college aged adults and middle aged adults one study that took years to complete showed that eating fast food was associated with diabetes and weight gain it also seems that if you live near a lot of fast food restaurants you are likely to eat more fast foods a study in ontario canada found that people who lived near a lot of fast food restaurants were more likely to have heart disease and even premature death another study revealed a correlation between the number of fast food restaurants per square mile and obesity in the contiguous states the states with the most fast food restaurants per square mile also had the highest rates of obesity researchers in new zealand gathered information from children and found a direct relationship between asthma and the number of hamburgers children ate those who ate the most hamburgers had the most asthma the bad side of fast food is not just a problem for american citizens hispanic and asian american adolescents who have recently immigrated to the united states quickly assimilate american culture within one year after arriving in the united states many immigrants exercise less and start to eat more fast foods typical american behaviors that lead to obesity and chronic disease they learn to live like americans and they will die like americans but wait it gets worse what the results of this research revealed is bad but the problems with eating most fast food are much worse researchers from around the world have been carefully studying what people eat and what diseases they get later in life using very large research studies they have been able to identify diets that either contribute to good health or are associated with chronic diseases there are two diet patterns that appear to either cause or prevent chronic diseases the diet pattern associated with the best health is called the prudent diet the diet that is the most unhealthy is called the western diet western refers to countries that have become westernized basically the industrialized nations of the world that are a lot like america this western diet is fairly typical of what many americans eat especially those who eat a lot of fast food typical foods of the western diet include the following red meat french fries refined flours butter processed meat high fat dairy products few fruits and vegetables sweets and desserts the prudent diet on the other hand is quite different the pyramid below shows what the prudent diet looks like for many americans it may look nothing like what they normally eat the prudent diet pattern http www hsph harvard edu nutritionsource used with permission the top of the pyramid suggests that foods shown here should be eaten sparingly notice that many of the foods listed there are part of the western diet the prudent diet is based on healthy plant oils whole grains fruits and vegetables nuts and legumes beans fish poultry and eggs which of these patterns best describes your diet do you follow a prudent diet or a western diet through large studies with hundreds of thousands of participants researchers determined that if you follow a prudent diet you lower your risk of developing diabetes by but if you follow a western diet your risk of developing diabetes increases by the prudent diet is associated with a decrease in risk of heart stop go fast food nutrition guide stop go fast food nutrition guide disease and the western diet was linked with a increase in heart disease risk these two diet patterns were even associated with other chronic diseases like colon cancer and strokes those who eat a prudent diet reduce their risk of chronic disease those who eat a western diet significantly increase their risk while these two diet patterns were accurate in describing who might and who might not get diabetes heart disease stroke and colon cancer not all chronic diseases are related to these two diet patterns when the same patterns were used to determine who might get breast or prostate cancer there was no difference between the two however a prudent diet does appear to help breast cancer survivors avoid other causes of death not associated with the cancer individuals who eat typical american fast food are eating a western diet most fast food contains a lot of red and processed meats white flour butter and other high fat dairy products french fries and sweets and desserts are very popular fast foods in fact fast food is a western diet that means that most fast food is actually causing many of the chronic diseases most americans suffer from including obesity there s more ahhh the smell of fresh pastries cookies and cakes who can resist almost all foods that are commercially fried are fried in trans fats we ve been hearing a lot about trans fats in the news and now all packaged foods are required to display information about trans fat content trans fats are plant oils that are altered in a process called hydrogenation in this process healthy plant oils are heated to about degrees and hydrogen gas and a metal catalyst are added this makes the vegetable oil accept additional hydrogen atoms and presto what used to be a healthy vegetable oil is now a saturated fat with special properties it can be used to fry food over and over again without going rancid and it has a very long shelf life almost all fast food restaurants use trans fats for frying because it is relatively inexpensive furthermore trans fats have a texture most people like for example margarine which is made mostly from trans fats is softer than real butter and easier to work with and pie crusts crackers and croissants are flakier when made with trans fats this is where science once again shows us some warning signs there have been studies that have looked at links between trans fats and chronic disease all but of the studies showed that consuming trans fats is probably harmful the prudent diet pyramid shows that healthy plant oils like olive peanut and soybean oil should be part of a healthy diet these oils are high in poly and monounsaturated fats they are actually good for you because they improve your blood cholesterol trans fats on the other hand dramatically increase your risk of heart disease because they make cholesterol worse in fact trans fats are thought to be times worse than saturated fats if you are going to eat fast foods you are going to dramatically increase your risk of heart attack and stroke because most fast foods contain a lot of trans fats this research is so convincing that the latest u s government nutrition recommendations encourage americans to keep the intake of trans fats as low as possible the minimum amount of trans fats a person can consume and not increase risk is zero dr walter willett chair of the department of nutrition at the harvard school of public health recently stated in europe food companies hired chemists and took trans fats out in the united states they hired lawyers and public relations people no one doubted trans fats have adverse affects on health and still companies were not taking it out any fast food that is deep fried is likely to be fried in trans fats as you will see in this guide some fast food companies no longer use trans fats but most still do if the safe recommended amount of trans fats is zero should you eat a large order of mcdonald s french fries if it contains grams of trans fats what about the yummy doughnuts at krispy kreme they are fried in trans fats and in this guide they are all coded red to help remind you to avoid eating them since fast food is purchased hot it is not required to have a nutrition label and you will never really know about the trans fat content think of all the fried foods in american fare french fries onion rings corn dogs popcorn seafood chips and oooh those bakery goods maple bars doughnuts croissants clairs all of them are either made with trans fats or are deep fried in trans fats the only way you would know would be if you were to see a list of the ingredients or to read the label on the oil being used you won t see the words trans fats in the ingredients if a food has trans fats it will be listed as partially hydrogenated oil the technical term for trans fats according to a survey conducted by the center for science in the public interest cspi the biggest restaurant chains still fry french fries chicken nuggets and other foods in trans fats the cspi survey which included major food manufacturers restaurant chains and supermarket chains revealed many interesting insights into the fast food industry for example while several major restaurant chains including taco bell and pizza hut are testing healthier oils only a few chains have already taken action to actually use healthier oils stop go fast food nutrition guide the good guys au bon pain a location caf chain based in boston has eliminated trans fat from all of its cookies bagels and muffins and is now using a nonhydrogenated margarine jason s deli a outlet sandwich and salad chain has stopped using partially hydrogenated oils in all of its products panera bread a outlet caf chain that was formerly part of au bon pain is in the process of replacing all partially hydrogenated oils and plans to be trans fat free by year s end california pizza kitchen has removed trans fat from deep fried foods and is working on eliminating it from all other foods in ruby tuesday with some table service restaurants around the country began deep frying in heart healthy canola oil chick fil a fries in peanut oil in its outlets the bad guys starbucks ice cream chain friendly s and fried chicken chain popeyes indicated they had no plans to remove or reduce trans fat in their foods meals at other restaurants also are loaded with trans fat kfc s chicken pot pie contains grams of trans and taco bell s nachos bellgrande has grams from http www cspinet org new pdf trans report pdf in mcdonald s promised to reduce and ultimately eliminate the trans fat in its cooking oil but in it quietly backed away from this effort mcdonald s lost a lawsuit related to this matter and was ordered to give million to the american heart association to be used to educate the public about the dangers of trans fats mcdonald s has reformulated its chicken mcnuggets and a few other products to have a little less trans fat but its fried foods are still very high in trans fats a mcdonald s meal that includes a five piece chicken selects breast strips order and a medium order of french fries has about grams of trans fats a piece of baked apple pie at mcdonald s has grams isn t it strange that mcdonald s outlets in australia denmark and israel all fry in trans fat free oil but americans still get the trans fats so what s the big deal if americans would reduce the amount of trans fats they are currently eating it is estimated that to heart disease deaths would be prevented every year that would provide a bigger improvement in public health than just about any other medical breakthrough in the past years but this guide isn t just about trans fats fruits and vegetables and whole grains are also very important a review of the science reveals that americans who increase their fruit and vegetable stop go fast food nutrition guide consumption from two servings per day to five or more can cut their risk of many cancers in half obviously scientists haven t answered all the nutrition questions but they have discovered enough information to help americans prevent arrest and even reverse most chronic diseases all it takes is good nutrition regular physical activity and avoiding tobacco use be careful what you order a quick look at many of the foods in this guide reveals a few surprises first of all the calorie content of some of america s fast food is shocking let s put this into perspective the average person weighs pounds when walking at a pace of miles per hour that person expends about calories per minute say you decide to have dinner at chili s and for a starter you order the awesome blossom this starter contains calories if you were the average person you would have to walk miles to burn off all the calories you just ate and it would take you about hours of walking to do it the table below shows some other fast food calorie counts that you might find enlightening appetizer starters chili s awesome blossom denny s mini burgers w onion rings entr es mcdonald s hamburger mcdonald s big mac romano s macaroni grill spaghetti meatballs dinner nathan s

sauce calories miles you would need to walk to burn off these calories miles miles miles miles miles miles miles miles miles miles how long you have to walk hours hours hour hours hours hours hours hours hours hours how this guide was developed to help you make healthy fast food choices almost different foods have been color coded after an exhaustive process used to determine if a food should be red yellow or green we contacted the largest fast food companies in america and requested nutrition information about each of their menu items companies are not required by law to provide the nutrition information for the foods they sell this is strictly voluntary and most stop go fast food nutrition guide stop go fast food nutrition guide companies do not have any nutrition information about their foods still we were able to gather nutrition information from restaurants the available nutrition information on these fast foods was then entered into a large database and specifically designed computer programs identified foods that had any of the following characteristics more than gram of trans fat per serving more than grams of saturated fat per serving more than milligrams of cholesterol per serving more than milligrams of sodium per serving there is nothing magical about these criteria except that some of them represent half the daily value for an average person in other words if a single fast food serving had more than half the amount of saturated fat cholesterol or sodium that a person should have in a single day it was identified foods that contained lots of trans fats and little fiber were also identified any food that met none or just one of these criteria started off as green any food that met two of the criteria was initially coded yellow and any food that met three or more of the criteria was coded red kind of like three strikes and you re out there is an easier way to think about this coding by using the prudent diet pyramid a similar type of coding could be done the pyramid shown below shows how foods could be coded according to where they are located on the pyramid healthy green coded foods would be those at the bottom of the pyramid yellow toward the middle and red foods which should be eaten sparingly are located at the top red meat butter use sparingly adapted from http www hsph harvard edu nutritionsource a further set of rules was also established to help in the coding process any food that had more than gram of trans fat was automatically coded red foods that contained processed meats meats like pepperoni bacon sausage bologna and hot dogs or more than the recommended serving of red meat were also coded red foods that were initially coded as yellow and had amounts of sodium saturated fat or cholesterol that were not extremely high but were leaning in that direction were moved to red to ensure consistent coding the entire fast food dataset was reevaluated and coded three times to further classify the foods a distinguished panel of national nutrition and health promotion experts from across the united states was organized these experts reviewed the entire process and suggested changes in the way the foods were coded the experts are listed in the acknowledgments section a final analysis shows that of the foods in this guide are coded green are coded yellow and are coded red fast food and good health with three easy rules how can you make the best choices when you re eating fast food this guide codes food as red yellow or green depending on how healthy they are or not here are three easy rules to help you use this system to make healthy fast food choices rule avoid the red foods rule go easy on the yellow foods rule eat healthy with the green foods red foods hit the brakes there are many factors that result in a red code for a food the number one factor why many foods receive a red code is that they contain more than one gram of trans fat lots of foods are coded red because they have more than one gram of trans fat content almost all of the foods at taco bell for example are coded red because they contain large amounts of trans fats many restaurants do not report the trans fat content of their foods indicated in the table as not available na leading us to believe that they are still frying in trans fats see popeyes chicken biscuits for example consequently they are coded red french fries are coded red because almost all restaurants fry them in trans fats any company that switches to healthier oils could instantly get a change in its food colors for example the in n out burger chain located in california nevada and arizona fries in cottonseed oil that is not hydrogenated it s trans fat free and better for you but french fries should still be a small part of a healthy stop go fast food nutrition guide diet in n out burger s french fries get a green code the only other restaurant that uses healthy oils for frying is chick fil a which has mostly green coded foods because they fry in peanut oil as you will read later foods fried in healthy oils can actually be good for you panda express does not use trans fats in any of its fried food and is the only restaurant in this entire guide that receives a green code for all of its foods on the other hand doughnut producers krispy kreme and dunkin donuts have only red coded foods because they are all made with trans fats one doughnut can have as much as grams of trans fats doughnuts are a wonderful treat but they are also a food that should be eaten very sparingly if you care about good health foods made with processed meats or that have a large serving of red meat are also coded red a mcdonald s regular hamburger the small one that has just a squirt of ketchup mustard and a pickle is actually coded green it contains a small serving of red meat and not very many calories a big mac on the other hand is a real heavy hitter with half the saturated fat for a whole day and trans fats how would you color code a pizza hut meat lover s pizza even though it doesn t contain any trans fats it gets a red in this guide because one slice contains a lot of saturated fat sodium and processed meat desserts typically offered at restaurants are coded red because they generally contain a lot of calories saturated fat refined flour and sugars therefore desserts should be an occasional treat not foods we eat often yellow foods exercise caution what about a pizza that doesn t contain any processed meat your basic cheese pizza gets a yellow code although it doesn t contain trans fats or processed meat it also doesn t contain any vegetables or whole grains it s kind of in the middle that s what yellow foods are like they aren t good enough to be coded green or bad enough to deserve being branded red some yellow foods include cheese pizza sweet and sour chicken a single taco or burrito frozen yogurt green foods you re eatin healthy green foods are the best to earn the green badge of honor a food has to have certain qualities that make it part of a healthy daily diet obviously foods made with whole grains fruits vegetables and healthy oils will be coded green green coded foods include vegetable pizza many sandwiches salads eggs and entr es made with vegetables such as vegetable stir fry green foods are low in saturated and trans fats they don t contain excessive amounts stop go fast food nutrition guide of sodium or cholesterol and they are relatively low in calories compared to yellow and red foods they are actually good for you and could be eaten every day by choosing green foods you can eat fast food and still eat healthy the best of both worlds another way to identify green foods is to ask the question is this food close to its natural original form a salad for example contains foods close to their natural form a hostess twinkie on the other hand leaves us to wonder what its natural form actually was a baked potato is going to be coded green but trans fat fried tater tots are going to be red you get the idea some restaurants are healthier than others as you will see in this guide some fast food restaurants sell a lot of red foods others have a lot more healthy choices based on the types of foods a restaurant serves it is possible to produce a short list of restaurants ranked from best to worst according to the color coding of the food they sell counting up the number of green yellow and red foods sold by different restaurants shows that some restaurants offer healthier foods than others worst breakfastspecialty denny s wafflehouse traditional fast food with trans fats burger king kfc mcdonald s mexican tacobell deltaco tacojohn s italian sbarro pizza pizza hut traditional fast food without trans fats chick fil a in n out healthyasianfoods pandaexpress sandwichshops subway blimpie bostonmarket best a few fast food marketing tricks you should know about fast food restaurants are really designed and created to do one thing sell as much food as possible it doesn t matter if people eat the food because the main goal is to sell food to do this food venders use time tested methods to get each customer to buy as much food as possible no one likes to waste food so when we do purchase a little extra food the only responsible thing to do is eat it don t fall prey to these tricks and you won t feel obligated to eat all the food you buy up selling would you like egg rolls with that order do you want me to super size your meal would you like to make that a combo meal these are all questions you might be asked next time you order fast stop go fast food nutrition guide food it s called up selling you ve already ordered what you want you re ready to pay and the person working at the counter asks you an up sell question the idea is to get as much money out of you as possible by selling you more food food that you may or may not want or need mcdonald s super sizing items and selling foods as part of a combo meal are examples of effective ways fast food restaurants get just a little more out of you each time you visit don t fall for it decide what you want before you get to the counter hopefully picking green coded foods and don t buy any more food no matter how hard the employee tries to sell it to you what smells so good have you ever walked past a restaurant and smelled barbeque fresh bread or hot pastries most food producers don t purposely fill the air with the smells of their foods but some do by setting up a barbeque grill outside or venting kitchen grill smoke to the outside they are advertising their food to the olfactory senses of the masses if you re hungry and you ve got a little extra cash you may end up as their next customer it s all about the playground forget about the food the kids will want to play at the fast food playground slides treehouses ball pits and swings are attractive to small children and playgrounds and even arcades have become common features in fast food restaurants restaurants know parents want to watch their kids play in a relatively confined space while they eat in peace the combination of food and an attraction for the kids is a powerful marketing ploy unfortunately the food often doesn t contribute to good health forget the food i want the toy the fast food industry excels at getting to us through our kids and the kid s meal is another powerful fast food marketing tactic hollywood and the fast food industry have collaborated to create a marriage between fast food and movie marketing that results in children begging for the next plastic action hero that comes with fast food they might or might not eat after all what could be better than sharing a deep fried meal with luke skywalker it s all in a name restaurant owners are pros at getting us to buy and eat if a menu has chocolate cake it won t sell well but if the same menu has black forest double chocolate cake the customer will be much more likely to purchase it and much more likely to approve of the taste why would romano s macaroni grill sell cheesecake when it can sell new york cheesecake with caramel fudge sauce just the name of the food can impact sales and customer satisfaction don t be swayed too stop go fast food nutrition guide much by the names listen to your body and let your stomach tell you when you are full fast food is only part of the problem it wouldn t be fair to place all of the blame for america s poor health on the fast food industry there are several reasons why americans are not as healthy as they should be regardless of what we eat we eat too much we don t get much exercise and we have a culture and environment that discourage healthy eating and regular physical activity this guide is designed to help you still enjoy fast food by selecting fast foods that are actually good for you when combined with regular exercise you will be well on your way to good health and a healthy body weight when all is said and done
